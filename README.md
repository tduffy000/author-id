### Author identification
Serves as practice for Intro to Data Science (DSE I1020) final. Can we correctly classify lines of text from 
the plays of Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare? Using a Logistic Regression classifer, we pull in 4 plays 
from each author from Project Gutenberg and split into lines. These are then vectorizer and used to train
and test the classification model.
